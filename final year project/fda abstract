This project aims at smartely storing and updating the visitors details for any institution,when a visitor visits the place his/her details will be fetched/extracted from adhaar card through our mobile application.Details then will be submitted to the database and will be automatically shown on the desktop of the receptionist,the variable fields like "reason of visit","whom to meet" ,will be entered by the receptionnist and the data will be saved.
When the user will visit again, there is now no need of rescanning the adhaar as the user was already created at the first visit,searching through phone number will display the user and the variable fields can be changed according to the need,the count of the visits will be incremented.
The admin section is used to create receptionist,and generate overall report of the visitors.
Our objective is to bring a change in society by automating the process of registration and reducing paper usage at any institutions by Front Desk Assistant(FDA).
